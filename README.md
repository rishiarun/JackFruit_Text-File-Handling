# Text & String Tools using Python (Tkinter GUI)

This project is developed as part of the **PCPS Jackfruit Mini-Project**.
It is a GUI-based Python application that performs multiple text and string
processing operations in a single interface.

---

## 📖 Project Description

The **Text & String Tools** application provides three main functionalities:
1. Word Frequency Analysis from text files
2. Palindrome Checking for user-input strings
3. Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption

The application is built using **Python** and **Tkinter**, making it easy to
use through a graphical user interface instead of command-line input.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- To analyze word frequency from a given text file
- To check whether a given string is a palindrome
- To encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher technique
- To demonstrate Python GUI programming and string manipulation concepts

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **GUI Library:** Tkinter
- **Modules Used:**
  - tkinter
  - ttk
  - filedialog
  - messagebox
  - string
  - collections.Counter

---

## 🧩 Features

### 1. Word Frequency Analyzer
- Reads text files
- Removes punctuation and normalizes text
- Displays word counts sorted by frequency

### 2. Palindrome Checker
- Ignores case sensitivity
- Ignores spaces and special characters
- Displays whether the input string is a palindrome

### 3. Caesar Cipher
- Encrypts text using a shift value
- Decrypts encrypted text
- Preserves non-alphabet characters

---

## 🧱 Data Structures Used

- Strings
- Lists
- Dictionaries (Counter)

## ⚠️ Challenges Faced

- Handling punctuation and special characters correctly
- Designing a clean and user-friendly GUI
- Validating user input and handling errors

---

## 🚀 Scope for Improvement

- Add more encryption algorithms
- Improve UI design and themes
- Export results to external files
- Support for large text files

---

## ✅ Conclusion

The project successfully demonstrates the use of Python, Tkinter,
file handling, and string processing techniques in a practical
GUI-based application.
